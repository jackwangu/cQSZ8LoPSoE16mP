Mechanical mechanics is the branch of physics that studies the behavior and laws of objects under the action of forces and motion. It includes the study of fundamental physical quantities such as force, torque, motion, energy, and momentum, and encompasses areas such as statics, dynamics, and material mechanics.

1. **Statics**: The study of mechanical problems involving objects in a state of equilibrium. The fundamental principle of statics is that the external forces and external torques acting on an object must be balanced, or the object will experience motion or deformation. Common applications include the design and analysis of buildings, bridges, mechanical components, etc.

2. **Dynamics**: The study of the motion of objects under the action of forces. It primarily involves Newton's laws of motion and the equations of motion. Dynamics focuses on the changes in acceleration, velocity, displacement, and how forces influence the state of motion of an object.

3. **Material Mechanics**: The study of the deformation and fracture behavior of materials under external forces, involving concepts such as stress, strain, strength, and stiffness. It is a fundamental discipline in engineering, widely applied in mechanical design, structural engineering, aerospace, and other fields.

The applications of mechanical mechanics are vast, ranging from everyday transportation tools to various industrial machinery, and even to high-tech fields like aerospace and robotics. Through in-depth study of mechanical mechanics, we can better understand and predict the motion behavior and load-bearing capacity of objects, thereby improving design and engineering efficiency and safety.
